  <p id= "Trans"> Transportation #3</p> <p> My neighborhood has any local buses, trains, and even dollar vans. My neighborhood is very convenient travel wise. Theres so many trains such as the 2 train and the 5 train. There's also many busses such as the Bm2, 103, B6, 41, 46 and many more. My neighborhood has different routes that many people can take ANYWHERE! This transportation system that my neighborhood has is very helpful and useful, especially for someone who lives in brooklyn and travels to Laguardia Highschool which is located in the city of Manhattan.</p>
